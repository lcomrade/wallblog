# Frequently Asked Questions
## Why is there no support for Windows and OSX?
There are several reasons for this:
1. I do not support proprietary software. And I'm not going to help users who use it.
2. Windows and OSX are not server OSs.
3. Windows is not POSIX compliant.

You can try to build a program for these operating systems.
But it may not work at all or it may not work as intended.
